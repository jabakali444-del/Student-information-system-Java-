## About the Project
The **Student Information System** is a small Java project designed for learning and practice.
It can be used to understand:
- Java fundamentals and OOP
- Menu-driven programs (for CLI apps)
- Basic data handling (in-memory, file-based, or database-backed depending on implementation)

---

## Features
Common features include:
- Add a student
- View all students
- Search by student ID or name
- Update student information
- Delete a student record

> If your implementation differs (GUI, database, etc.), tell me and I will tailor this README exactly to your code.

---

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8+ (recommended: 11 or 17)
- (Optional) IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

---

## How to Run

### Run in an IDE
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jabakali444-del/Student-information-system-Java-.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Find the file containing:
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args)
   ```
4. Run the project.

### Run from the command line (basic Java project)
> Update the commands based on your folder structure and main class name.

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/**/*.java
   ```
2. Run (replace `MainClassName`):
   ```bash
   java -cp out MainClassName
   ```

## How to Use
After starting the program, follow the on-screen menu/options to manage student records.

Typical operations:
- Add new student information
- Display student list
- Search, edit, or delete a student

---

## Project Notes
- Data storage method depends on the implementation (in-memory / file / database).
- If you want, share your `src/` structure and I can document:
  - exact main class
  - exact run steps
  - real features present in your code

---

## Future Improvements
Ideas you can add later:
- Persistent storage using MySQL/SQLite
- Input validation and duplicate ID checks
- Export student list to CSV/PDF
- GUI using Swing or JavaFX
- Role-based access (admin/staff)
